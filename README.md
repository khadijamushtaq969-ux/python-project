# project 4:

## Project title: Visual Question Answering with Transformers

This project implements a **Visual Question Answering (VQA) system** using HuggingFace Transformers.  
The model takes an **image** and a **natural language question** as input, and generates the most relevant answer.  

### Features:
- Uses HuggingFace pre-trained VQA model  
- Accepts both **image + text question** as input  
- Returns natural language answers  
- Demonstrates the power of multimodal AI (Computer Vision + NLP)

# project 5:
# project title: Vector Embedding and Databases
This project demonstrates how to generate **vector embeddings** from text using machine learning models and store them in a **vector database** for efficient semantic search and retrieval.  
It shows how embeddings can be created, indexed, and queried to enable powerful search applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, and natural language understanding.

# project 6:
# project title:"LangChain with Google Gemini API"
This project shows how to integrate **LangChain** with **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** using the `langchain_google_genai` package.  
It demonstrates how to invoke Gemini models (like `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to generate natural language responses, such as jokes, conversations, or any AI-powered text generation tasks.
